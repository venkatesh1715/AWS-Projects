# Website Orchestration
```
Industry: Internet related

## Problem Statement:
How to orchestrate a website with lesser time and higher availability along with Auto Scaling.

## Topics:
In this AWS project, you have to deploy a high-availability PHP application with an external Amazon RDS database to Elastic Beanstalk. Running a DB instance external to Elastic Beanstalk decouples the database from the lifecycle of your environment. This lets you connect to the same database from multiple environments, swap one database for another, or perform a blue/green
deployment without affecting your database.

## Highlights:
    Launch a DB instance in Amazon RDS
    Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment
    Configure Security Groups and Scaling.
