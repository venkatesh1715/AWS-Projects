# Case Study 1
```
## Problem Statement:
You work for XYZ Corporation that uses on premise solutions and a limited number of systems. With the increase in requests in their application, the load also increases. So, to handle the load the corporation has to buy more systems almost on a regular basis. Realizing the need to cut down the expenses on systems, they decided to move their infrastructure to AWS.

## Tasks To Be Performed:
1) Manage the scaling requirements of the company by:
	a. Deploying multiple compute resources on the cloud as soon as the load increases and the CPU utilization exceeds 80%
	b. Removing the resources when the CPU utilization goes under 60%
2) Create a load balancer to distribute the load between compute resources.
3) Route the traffic to the company's domain.
